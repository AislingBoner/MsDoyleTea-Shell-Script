# MsDoyleTea-Shell-Script
The objective of the task is to (using the Vim text editor) write a shell script program that behaves like an Irish person offering a cup of tea. If the user types ‘y’ to the offer, the program displays “Great, I’ll make tea now” to the console. If the user types ‘n’ to the offer, the program asks the user “Are you sure” 4 more times before giving up. If at any point during the 4 follow up offers, the user changes their mind and presses ‘y’, the computer will print out “Great, I’ll make tea now” to the console. In addition to shell scripting, this assignment examines your ability to use ‘while loops’ and’ if statements’ correctly. It also examines your ability to research and locate the information required online.
