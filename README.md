# MsDoyleTea-Shell-Script

The objective of this task was to write a shell script program using the Vim text editor that behaves like an Irish person offering a cup of tea.For this example I used the ionic Ms.Doyle in Father Ted.

Description of the Program:
If the user types ‘y’ to the offer, the program displays “Great, I’ll make tea now” to the console. If the user types ‘n’ to the offer, the program asks the user “Are you sure” 4 more times before giving up. If at any point during the 4 follow up offers, the user changes their mind and presses ‘y’, the computer will print out “Great, I’ll make tea now” to the console. This program examines ability to use ‘while loops’ and’ if statements’ correctly in shell script.
